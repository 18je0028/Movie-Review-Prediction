We want to solve the problem of binary classification of IMDB movie reviews.
We have a training set with marked reviews, 12500 reviews marked as good, another 12500 bad.
We will use a simple approach: bag of words model.
We will use CountVectorizer and then use logistic regression to solve this review prediction.
